    <h5>Meet Julie Lin</h5>
    <div class="h_divider"></div>
    <p>I have been working in the beauty industry for 15 years, during which I have worked on photo shoots, fashion shows, hair shows, movie sets, even operated a salon for 2 years.  All those years of experiences helped me grow as a hairstylist and made me realize that my true passion is working behind a chair and taking care of my clients.  Every single person that sits on my styling chair deserves my full attention, my best quality of work and service because I truly care! </p>
    <p>Yves Saint Laurent: "Fashions fade, style is eternal." that is my hair philosophy. My style of cutting is to enhance one's natural texture whether it's curly, straight or everything in between. I design hair to compliment client's facial features and their lifestyle. I educate my clients on how to take care of their hair at home, good hair day every day. Hair color is my strong suit, COLOR QUEEN is my nick name. Either jazzing up your hair color or a complete make over, I'm your girl!</p>
    <p>I'm always driving to be better than I'm today! Please write a review and send me feedback, it will be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time!</p>
